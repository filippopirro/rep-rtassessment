RIVERTECH ASSESSMENT PLAYBOOK

Assessment notes and how-tos.



1. PREMISES

Due to the amount of time I have spent to setup the different containers, the
work is incomplete. A brief desrption how what has been delivered:
- Docker:	the reuqested containers have been created. I have found some examples
			and I have customized them and make them work together. A real
			challenge.
- NiFi:		done and tested. Files are loaded into Kafka.
- KSql:		I did not manage to rn the scripts and read data from Kafka and import 
			them into the database. I wrote the scripts (and the curl commands) in
			the way I think they should have worked.
- Service:	not done at all.



2. RUN THE CONTAINERS

To run the containers, load the CSV files the following file must be launched:
run_dock-compose.sh (./run_dock_compose).



3. NiFi

The XML file in the project is also stored in the NiFi container at:
/opt/nifi/scripts



4. KSql

The curl commands have been perhaps are using an incorrect address.
I did notfindthe way to ake sure that is the right address.



5. Microservice

I just went to that theoretically.
I consume all the time on the other tasks.
